# NeoJav!

jdk17 but i looked around, hopefully trying to optimize old code. 
this isnt really anything serious, this is just a side project.
i dont really know how to code but i'll look around and get help from codex or cursor.
theres probably a shit ton of errors but this is just a test and i'll probaly abandon it
